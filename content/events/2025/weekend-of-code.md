## About Weekend of Code

**Weekend of Code** is a multi-event coding fest exclusively for first- and second-year students, bringing together three core competitions—DevJam (development hackathon), Turing’s Playground (AI/ML hackathon), and CodeStart (ICPC-style coding contest). It’s a focused platform to learn, build, compete, and push your problem-solving skills.

### What Makes Weekend of Code Special

- **Three Competitive Events** across development, AI/ML, and competitive programming
- **Industry Mentorship** from leading tech companies
- **Exclusively for 1st & 2nd Years**
- **Mentorship & Guidance** from peers
- **Workshops** and learning sessions
