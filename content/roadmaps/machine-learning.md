- Matrix Operations
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Applications in Machine Learning

### Calculus

- Derivatives and Gradients
- Chain Rule
- Partial Derivatives
- Optimization

### Probability & Statistics

- Probability Distributions

## Recommended Learning Path Timeline

This timeline is flexible and should be adapted to your learning speed.

1. **Months 1-2:** Mathematics Foundation and Python for ML.
2. **Months 3-5:** Machine Learning Fundamentals and applied projects.
3. **Months 6-8:** Deep Learning and framework mastery.
4. **Months 9-12:** Advanced topics, specialization, and a project.

**Important:** Consistent implementation and coding practice in Python is crucial. Use AI tools for understanding concepts and documentation, but avoid copying code directly.
